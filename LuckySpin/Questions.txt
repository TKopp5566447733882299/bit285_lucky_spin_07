Why use the repository player information to initialize the SpinViewModel?(HINT: See what happens if you comment out the code to initialize it.)

	If the data is not entered with the repository then the data is instantiated with thir default values so therefore the luck and balance are 0 
	And the name is set to nothing.

What else does the SpinViewModel's method ChargeSpin() do besides charge for spin? Where is this method used?

	It is used to check if the player has enough to play in the spinnerController

Where is the logic to determine a winning spin? Where is this method used?

	The property is found in the spin veiw model and is called to check if luck is contained in the numbers array.

Why is it necessary to update the dbContext player's balance from the spinViewModel after a spin?

	It is nessasary because after the spinVeiwmodel will charge the players balance and update the DB and is taken later on
